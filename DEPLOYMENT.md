# 🚀 NAVADA Deployment Guide

## ⚠️ **Important: Vercel Limitations for Chainlit Apps**

**Chainlit applications are designed for persistent connections and may not work optimally on Vercel's serverless architecture.** Here are the recommended deployment options:

## 🎯 **Recommended Deployment Platforms**

### 1. **Railway (Recommended) ⭐**
- **Perfect for Chainlit apps**
- **Persistent connections supported**
- **Easy deployment from GitHub**

```bash
# Deploy to Railway
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Add environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY)
3. Deploy automatically
```

### 2. **Render (Excellent Alternative)**
- **Full support for Chainlit**
- **Free tier available**
- **Auto-deploys from GitHub**

```bash
# Deploy to Render
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Choose Web Service
3. Set build command: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set start command: chainlit run app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

### 3. **Fly.io (Developer-Friendly)**
- **Excellent for Python apps**
- **Global edge deployment**

```bash
# Deploy to Fly.io
flyctl launch
flyctl deploy
```

### 4. **Heroku (Classic Option)**
- **Well-established platform**
- **Good documentation**

```bash
# Deploy to Heroku
heroku create navada-app
git push heroku master
```

## 🔧 **Vercel Deployment (Limited Functionality)**

**Note: Vercel deployment will have limited functionality due to serverless constraints.**

### Quick Vercel Deployment:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy from repository**
```bash
cd your-navada-directory
vercel
```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

4. **Limitations on Vercel:**
- ❌ Real-time chat interface may not work
- ❌ Session memory limited
- ❌ File uploads may be restricted
- ❌ WebSocket connections not supported
- ✅ API endpoints will work
- ✅ Static content will serve

## 🌟 **Best Practice: Railway Deployment**

### Step-by-Step Railway Deployment:

1. **Go to Railway.app**
2. **Connect GitHub account**
3. **Select NAVADA repository**
4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your_openai_api_key
   - `PORT` = 8000 (Railway will override this)
   - `CHAINLIT_HOST` = 0.0.0.0

5. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Detect Python app
   - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
   - Run `chainlit run app.py`
   - Provide a public URL

6. **Access your app:**
   - Railway provides a unique URL like: `https://navada-production.up.railway.app`

## 🔐 **Environment Variables Setup**

For any platform, you'll need:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
CHAINLIT_HOST=0.0.0.0
CHAINLIT_PORT=8000
```

## 📋 **Platform Comparison**

| Platform | Chainlit Support | Free Tier | Ease of Setup | Performance |
|----------|------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Railway** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ $5/month | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Render** | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Limited | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Fly.io** | ✅ Good | ✅ Limited | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Heroku** | ✅ Good | ❌ $7/month | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Vercel** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |

## 🚀 **Quick Start: Railway (30 seconds)**

1. Visit [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Select your NAVADA repository
4. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
5. Deploy! 🎉

Your NAVADA app will be live with full functionality in under 2 minutes.

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

**App won't start:**
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check build logs for dependency errors

**Features not working:**
- Ensure you're not on Vercel (use Railway/Render instead)
- Check browser console for WebSocket errors
- Verify all environment variables are set

**Performance issues:**
- Use Railway or Fly.io for better performance
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for more resources

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**For the best NAVADA experience, use Railway or Render.** These platforms are specifically designed for applications like Chainlit that require persistent connections and real-time features.

Vercel is excellent for static sites and APIs, but Chainlit apps need the full server environment that Railway and Render provide.
